Project 6: Assembler


Step 1: Write a symbol-less assembler (i.e., will process only .asm files that don't have any symbols) 

Step 2: Test the assembler on MaxL.asm, RectL.asm, and PongL.asm 

Step 3: Extend your assembler with symbol-handling capabilities

 Step 4: Test the assembler on Add.asm, Max.asm, Rect.asm, and Pong.asm 

Step 5: Test the assembler on the Mult.asm and Fill.asm programs you wrote for project 4
