How to use my code in command-in Terminal

1. In terminal, enter: python project0 "your input file"
	In my example, it will be like "sampleFile.in"

2. The code will remove the blank lines, white space, and the word after comment "//"

3. Then, it will write the new file in your input file + ".out"
	In my example, it will be like "sampleFile.out"
